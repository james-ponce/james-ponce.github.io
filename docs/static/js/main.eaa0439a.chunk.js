As much of the United States has some form of internet it\u2019s been much more lucrative for companies to begin investing in other countries where they can get more users to pay for their services even if the services aren\u2019t great. Much of rural America uses DSL which has a maximum speed of 35 megabits per second. Companies make no effort to innovate and update the infrastructure of rural America.",s.a.createElement("br",null),"This major lack of updated infrastructure leaves many lower income families struggling. People who are forced to use this slower tier internet are forced to be consumers rather than producers. In other words, they can\u2019t use the internet to create content efficiently. Someone who had a 100 megabit per second connection could download stuff 10 times faster. This doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal, but for a file that could exceed 10s of gigabytes this could be work days of time being saved.",s.a.createElement("br",null),"This same concern has been brought to light with Facebook\u2019s free basic internet program. It creates a group of people who are nothing but consumers.  The major problem with this is that many people today create some kind of living with an internet presence. During the massive pandemic many companies went online. Without a fast, stable, and high bandwidth connection many of these opportunities wouldn\u2019t have existed. From reading the developers documentation for Facebook\u2019s free basics program, this service is more of an isolated internet where developers need to submit a request for Facebook to let their users visit such websites. In a sense this program creates a fish bowl where people in the program can siphon money out of the system, but people in the system can\u2019t create something to make money within it.",s.a.createElement("br",null),s.a.createElement("br",null),"My point with this poster was to show how digital colonialism and internet in rural America show greedy similarities. If people aren\u2019t given the opportunity to escape poverty, then to make the attempt to leave is much riskier. These companies know it which is why they try to keep the users in a bowl. To show this I used a money fish where if the fish tries to escape the small enclosure. They are likely not to succeed. Instead they will suffer with lower speeds and be monitored.
